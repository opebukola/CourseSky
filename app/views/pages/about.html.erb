					<h3> Why Choose Us</h3><br />
					We believe that all learners deserve quality academic instruction and support. For those who aspire to college, CourseSky will offer courses that will prepare them for admission and for success. We're starting with Algebra 1 because research shows that success in Algebra is a key indicator of post-secondary success.  Our platform allows learners to learn at their own pace, with interactive video lessons, practice problems, and personalized skills reporting.

					<h3> Why We Started CourseSky</h3><br />
					Too many students leave high school unprepared for college and nearly 40% of college freshmen have to take remedial courses. In our years tutoring high school students, we saw many motivated students struggle due to poor instruction. Their families could not afford extra academic support, and the potential of bright students went unrealized. But the great news is that learners are no longer limited to what their schools offer. With CourseSky, every student can reach his or her full academic potential.

				<h4>Ope Bukola</h4>
				<p>Co-Founder/CEO</p>
				<hr>
				<p class="description">
					Ope first became interested in education during college while working as a home-school teacher and tutor.  She realized that many students had the motivation to succeed, but could not afford the best resources. She spent many years working in education before deciding to launch CourseSky to increase access to education for all students. Prior to starting CourseSky, Ope managed partnerships and marketing efforts for a non-profit provider of open-source textbooks. She's also worked in higher education and management consulting. She is a self-taught web developer, and a graduate of New York University where she earned a joint degree in Economics & Mathematics. When sheâ€™s not working on CourseSky, Ope enjoys listening to podcasts, reading magazines, blogging, and taking classes. She frequently enrolls in MOOCs, and not-so-frequently completes them.
