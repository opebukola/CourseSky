					<h4>Ope Bukola</h4>
					<p>Founder</p>
					<hr>
					<p class="description">
						Ope first became interested in education during college while working as a home-school teacher and tutor.  She realized that many students had the motivation to succeed, but could not afford the best academic resources. She spent many years working in education before deciding to launch CourseSky. Prior to CourseSky, Ope managed partnerships and marketing efforts for a non-profit provider of open-source textbooks. She's also worked in higher education and management consulting. She is a self-taught web developer, and a graduate of New York University where she earned a joint degree in Economics & Mathematics. When sheâ€™s not working on CourseSky, Ope enjoys listening to podcasts, reading magazines, blogging, and taking online classes.
